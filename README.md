# Project Title: Detect Counterfeit Banknotes with Python

## Project Overview

You are a Data Analyst consultant working for a data-focused company. Your company has been assigned a contract with the National Organization for Combating Counterfeiting Money (ONCFM). The ONCFM aims to develop methods for identifying counterfeit Euro banknotes. They have enlisted your expertise in data analysis to build a predictive model that can automatically distinguish genuine from counterfeit banknotes using specific dimensions and characteristics of the banknotes.

In this project, you will work directly at the ONCFM premises under the supervision of Marie, the project lead for data analysis. Marie will give you autonomy in your work and expects you to present the results at the end of the project. She is interested in understanding your data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, various approaches explored for algorithm construction, and the final model chosen.

After reviewing the detailed project requirements, you prepare to start your assignment at the ONCFM. However, you find a post-it note left on your desk by one of your colleagues:

"During my previous assignment, I dealt with a dataset that had many missing values. It was quite a challenge! However, I achieved excellent results by using linear regression to fill in the missing values. This might come in handy for your next mission, who knows?"

You pack the post-it note with your belongings and head towards the ONCFM offices to commence your mission.

## Deliverables

Complete code in R or Python: The developed code encompasses all the necessary processing and testing steps. It is organized in a clear, commented, and easily understandable manner.

Final application: An application has been created to implement the developed model for counterfeit banknote detection. Users can utilize this application by providing input data to obtain accurate predictions.

## Presentation

The project was presented and validated by a jury following the steps below:

Deliverables presentation: A presentation was made to showcase the overall project, including preprocessing steps, different algorithm exploration approaches, and the final selected model. The presentation lasted approximately 20 minutes (+/- 5 minutes).

Live algorithm testing: A live demonstration was conducted using a provided dataset similar to "billet_production.csv". The algorithm was successfully tested on this dataset for approximately 5 minutes.

Discussion: A question-and-answer session took place to discuss the choices and approaches used in the project. This discussion lasted approximately 5 minutes.

Debriefing: To conclude the presentation, the evaluator provided feedback and a debriefing on the project for approximately 5 minutes.
