# Project Title: Detect Counterfeit Banknotes with Python

## Project Overview
For this project, I worked as a Data Analyst consultant on a mission for the National Organization for Combating Counterfeiting Money (ONCFM). Our objective was to develop a Python-based predictive model to detect counterfeit Euro banknotes.

## Deliverables
- Complete Python code with comprehensive processing and testing steps.
- Final application: Implementation of the developed model for counterfeit banknote detection.

## Presentation
The project was presented to a jury following these steps:

1. Deliverables Presentation: The project was showcased, highlighting the preprocessing steps, algorithm exploration, and the final model. The presentation duration was approximately 20 minutes (+/- 5 minutes).

2. Live Algorithm Testing: A demonstration was conducted using a provided dataset similar to "billet_production.csv". The algorithm's performance was showcased in a live testing session, which lasted approximately 5 minutes.

3. Discussion: A Q&A session was held to discuss the project's choices and approaches. The jury had the opportunity to ask questions and engage in a discussion related to the project. The discussion duration was approximately 5 minutes.

4. Debriefing: Feedback and debriefing were provided to assess the project's outcomes and discuss any further insights. The debriefing session lasted approximately 5 minutes.
