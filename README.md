# Project Title: Detect Counterfeit Banknotes with Python

## Project Overview
You are a Data Analyst consultant working on a project for the National Organization for Combating Counterfeiting Money (ONCFM). The goal is to develop a predictive model using Python to identify counterfeit Euro banknotes.

## Deliverables
- Complete code in Python that includes all the necessary processing and testing steps.
- Final application: An implemented model for counterfeit banknote detection.

## Presentation
The project was presented to a jury in the following steps:
1. Deliverables presentation: Showcasing the project, including preprocessing, algorithm exploration, and the final model. Presentation duration: approximately 20 minutes (+/- 5 minutes).
2. Live algorithm testing: A demonstration using a provided dataset similar to "billet_production.csv". Duration: approximately 5 minutes.
3. Discussion: Q&A session to discuss the project's choices and approaches. Duration: approximately 5 minutes.
4. Debriefing: Feedback and debriefing on the project. Duration: approximately 5 minutes.

## Skills Assessed
- Predictive analysis
- Logistic regression
- Linear regression
