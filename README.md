# Scenario
![](readme_p10.jpg)



You are a Data Analyst consultant in a data-focused company. Your company has secured a service contract with the National Counterfeit Money Fighting Organization (ONCFM).

The objective of this institution is to implement methods for identifying counterfeit euro banknotes. They have reached out to you, a data specialist, to develop a model that can automatically identify genuine and counterfeit banknotes using specific dimensions and elements of the banknotes.

Here are the specifications provided by ONCFM, along with the dataset.

The client wants you to work directly from their premises, under the supervision of Marie, the project manager for data analysis at ONCFM. She will give you a significant level of autonomy during your assignment but requests that you present the results once the mission is complete. She would like to see the data processing and analysis you conducted, the various approaches explored for building the algorithm, and the final model selected.

After carefully reading the specifications, you prepare to go to ONCFM to assume your new responsibilities. However, you notice a post-it note on the corner of your desk left by one of your colleagues:

"In my previous assignment, I encountered a dataset with many missing values, a real challenge! But I achieved excellent results by using linear regression to fill in those gaps. Maybe it will be useful for your next mission, who knows?" You take the post-it note with you and head to ONCFM's offices to begin your assignment.
